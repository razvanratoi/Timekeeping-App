  This is a Timekeeping Application that would serve to a company where employees can log their worked hours in, request free days, check those requests, see projects,
tasks and edit them.
  There are 4 actors: a regular employee, which mainly can see entries of those enumerated above and add more;
                      team leader, with the same functionalities as the employee, but can add employees to team for some projects
                      project manager, that can add tasks to projects
                      admin, which has universal access across the application, they can see all of the logged hours, free days requests (and also approve/reject them),
see clients, add and assign a project manager to a project and add clients.
  The authentication for this app is based on credentials, but password encryption and uniqueness have yet to be implemented.
  The back-end is implemented in Java, using the Spring Boot framework, while the front-end is done in Angular. The database is managed with PostgreSQL.
